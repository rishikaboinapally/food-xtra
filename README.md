**Food Waste Management System**
This is a web-based platform for managing leftover food in restaurants, where NGOs that are registered on the platform can place orders and collect food from the restaurants. This system helps to reduce food waste and ensure that surplus food is utilized for the benefit of the community.


**How it works**
Restaurants can input the details of their leftover food on the website. This information includes the type of food, quantity, and expiry date. NGOs registered on the website can then browse through the available options and place orders for the food they need. The restaurants are notified of the orders and can prepare the food for collection by the NGOs. The credibility of both the restaurants and the NGOs is verified beforehand by an administrator when they attempt to register.
